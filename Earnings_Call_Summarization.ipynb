(NASDAQ:AAPL) Q4 2022 Earnings Conference Call October 27, 2022 5:00 PM ET\\r\\n\\r\\nCompany Participants\\r\\n\\r\\nTejas Gala - Director-Investor Relations & Corporate Finance\\r\\n\\r\\nTim Cook - Chief Executive Officer\\r\\n\\r\\nLuca Maestri - Chief Financial Officer\\r\\n\\r\\nConference Call Participants\\r\\n\\r\\nShannon Cross - Credit Suisse\\r\\n\\r\\nErik Woodring - Morgan Stanley\\r\\n\\r\\nBen Bollin - Cleveland Research\\r\\n\\r\\nKyle McNealy - Jefferies\\r\\n\\r\\nJim Suva - Citigroup\\r\\n\\r\\nAmit Daryanani - Evercore\\r\\n\\r\\nHarsh Kumar - Piper Sandler\\r\\n\\r\\nKrish Sankar - Cowen & Company\\r\\n\\r\\nOperator\\r\\n\\r\\nGood day, and welcome to the Apple Q4 Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. For your information, today's call is being recorded.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Tejas Gala, Director of Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nTejas Gala\\r\\n\\r\\nSpeaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Before turning the call over to Tim, I would like to remind you that approximately once every six years, we add a week to the December quarter to realign our fiscal periods with the December calendar. So this December quarter will span 14 weeks rather than the usual 13 and will end on December 31.\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expense, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of COVID-19 on the company's business and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements or information, which speak as of their respective dates.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\\r\\n\\r\\nTim Cook\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining the call today. Over the past year, despite a range of challenges facing the world, our teams have come together in incredible ways to drive unparalleled innovation and deliver again and again for our customers.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the September quarter, we reported record revenue of $90.1 billion, which was better than we anticipated despite stronger-than-expected foreign currency headwinds. We set an all-time revenue record for Mac and September quarter records for iPhone and Wearables, Home and Accessories. Services notched a September quarter record as well with revenue of $19.2 billion and more than 900 million paid subscriptions.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe reached another record on our installed base of active devices, thanks to a quarterly record of upgraders and double-digit growth in switchers on iPhone. Across nearly every geographic segment, we reached a new revenue record for the quarter. And we continue to perform incredibly well in emerging markets with very strong double-digit growth in India, Southeast Asia and Latin America.\\r\\n\\r\\nI'm also happy to report that during the quarter, silicon-related supply constraints were not significant. I want to acknowledge that we are still living through unprecedented times. From war in Eastern Europe to the persistence of COVID-19, from climate disasters around the world to an increasingly difficult economic environment, a lot of people and a lot of places are struggling. Through it all, we've aimed to help our customers navigate through the challenges while giving them the tools to drive progress for themselves and their communities.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Apple, creativity and collaboration have always been at the core of who we are. That spirit of ingenuity and teamwork helped us provide our customers with incredible innovations this year and led to another yearly revenue record.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn fiscal 2022, Apple achieved revenue of $394 billion, representing 8% annual growth. We set records for iPhone, Mac, Wearables, Home and Accessories and Services while growing double digits in emerging markets and setting records in the vast majority of markets we track.\\r\\n\\r\\nCustomers are loving our iPhone 14 lineup. Loaded with camera upgrades for sharper photos, Action Mode for smoother videos and new safety features like Crash Detection and Emergency SOS via Satellite, iPhone is even more indispensable to our daily lives.\\r\\n\\r\\niPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus come with a new dual-camera system, industry-leading durability, incredible power and amazing battery life. And our iPhone 14 Pro models are packed with even more groundbreaking innovations, including a new camera system as well as always-on display and the Dynamic Island, which offers a whole new way to interact with iPhone.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust yesterday, our most advanced iPad and iPad Pro ever landed in stores. With its all-screen design, advanced cameras and faster wireless connectivity, the tenth generation iPad looks and performs better than ever. For creatives, iPad Pro, now turbocharged by the blazingly fast M2 chip, is the perfect device to make something amazing.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur Mac customers have already been raving about the power of M2 since the arrival of our newest MacBook Air and MacBook Pro this summer. Their incredible long battery life, stunningly rich display and lightning fast speeds are a signature part of the Mac experience and helped drive an all-time record revenue for Mac during the September quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn Wearables, Home and Accessories a wave of innovation spurred 10% year-over-year revenue growth during the September quarter. New features in Apple Watch Series 8, including temperature sensing capabilities, retrospective ovulation estimates and crash detection are helping to keep customers healthier and safer.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the updated Apple Watch SE is a great way for users to start their Apple Watch journey, delivering advanced features at a new low price. The biggest, brightest and boldest Apple Watch ever made, Apple Watch Ultra pushes the boundaries of what a smartwatch can do.\\r\\n\\r\\nPacked with innovations like advanced navigation tools and the new Oceanic+ app, which turns it into a dive computer, Apple Watch Ultra has something for athletes and adventures on land and sea.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second generation of AirPods Pro powered by the new H2 chip are receiving rave reviews for delivering an unmatched wireless earbud audio experience, while canceling up to twice as much noise over the previous model. There's no better place to discover the rich spatial audio capabilities of AirPods Pro than Apple Music, the largest music catalog anywhere now with more than 100 million songs.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd there's no other company that fuses best-in-class hardware with cutting-edge software and services to create a truly integrated and seamless experience. With iOS 16, we're giving customers more ways to personalize their iPhones through a customizable lock screen and focus filters.\\r\\n\\r\\nNew features in Messages and Mail enable users to connect and collaborate like never before. Stage Manager in iPadOS 16 and macOS Ventura, helps users stay more productive with smoother multitasking. And watchOS 9 is empowering customers to live a healthier day through updates to the Sleep App, a new FDA-cleared AFib history feature and the new Medications app.\\r\\n\\r\\nAcross our Services, we continue to see enthusiasm and strong engagement from our subscribers. Apple TV+ hits like Severance, Bad Sisters and Blackbird have taken center stage on screens around the world. And baseball fans were glued to their seats this season watching Friday Night Baseball. Meanwhile, Apple TV+ productions continue to earn accolades. At the 74th Primetime Emmy Awards in September, Apple brought home 9 statues, including a second consecutive win for Best Comedy Series for Ted Lasso. And soon, we're going to give audiences an even better entertainment experience when the all-new Apple TV 4K hit stores next week.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe're also bringing Fitness+ to more customers than ever by making our entire library of over 3,000 studio-style workouts and meditations available to iPhone users in 21 countries, even those without an Apple Watch. These updates are arriving just in time for a new Artist Spotlight series with workouts featuring the music of Taylor Swift and a new workout program, Yoga for Every Runner featuring and design with one of the world's top ultramarathon athletes, Scott Jurek.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile Fitness+ helps subscribers stay active, Apple Card is designed with our customers' financial health in mind. For the second year in a row, Apple Card has been ranked highest in customer satisfaction for midsized credit card issuers by J.D. Power. And our users' favorite Apple Card benefit just got even better with the upcoming addition of a new high-yield savings account to help them save and grow their daily cash rewards.\\r\\n\\r\\nTurning to retail. Last month, our team members welcomed customers to the all-new Apple Jamsil in South Korea. And through today at Apple Creative Studios, we partnered with non-profits in cities around the world to help young diverse creatives pursue their passions and connect with local mentors. And our retail teams have done exceptional work, helping customers explore our latest products and features. As we approach the holiday season with our product lineup set, I'd like to share my gratitude to our retail, AppleCare and channel teams for the work they are doing to support customers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Apple, we're proud of the ways we are able to help customers be productive, get healthy, stay safe and unlock their creative potential. We also understand we have important responsibilities to the communities we serve. That's why we continue to invest in education, racial equity and justice and the environment. And we are making important progress toward a more inclusive and diverse workforce.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough our Community Education Initiative, we're working alongside more than 150 partners to help students around the world learn new science and technology skills. This summer, we joined with community partners to support coding academies across the United States from Code Academy in Nashville to One Summer Chicago to the Coding 5K Camp for Girls right next door in San Jose.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe've also just expanded our racial equity and justice initiative into the UK for the first time. Alongside the South Pink Center, we're helping aspiring creators develop their own voices and position themselves for long-lasting careers.\\r\\n\\r\\nBack in the US, we welcomed a new class of Black, Latino and indigenous entrepreneurs to Apple's second Impact Accelerator. This group of innovators is focused on using green technology to mitigate the effects of climate change and serve communities most affected by it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt Apple, we care deeply about protecting the planet for future generations. To that end, in support of our 2030 environmental goals, we have asked all of our suppliers to become carbon-neutral across their entire Apple-related footprint by the end of the decade. We are also providing them with resources based on what we learned achieving net-zero carbon in our own global operations.\\r\\n\\r\\nAcross our entire product lineup, we also continue to source more materials through recycling while taking less from the Earth. Every iPhone 14 is made with 100% recycled rare-earth elements in all magnets, including those used in MagSafe.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd in a first for Apple Watch and iPad, we're using recycled gold in the plating of multiple printed circuit boards in our newest devices. While we're working to reduce the footprint of our hardware, we're making changes to our software to be more environmentally-friendly with the soon-to-be released Clean Energy charging feature for iPhone.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur 2030 goal is a reflection of our relentless focus on the future at Apple. The world continues to be unpredictable as old challenges evolve and new ones emerge. What remains constant is the ability of our teams to create great products, services and experiences while being a force for good in the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhatever challenges lie ahead in the new year, we're moving forward, as we always have, investing for the long-term to deliver incredible innovations for our customers like only Apple can.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now, I'll hand it over to Luca for more details on our performance.\\r\\n\\r\\nLuca Maestri\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased to report record financial results for the September quarter that capped another record fiscal year for Apple despite a challenging and volatile macroeconomic backdrop.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe reached a September quarter revenue record of $90.1 billion, up 8% year-over-year despite over 600 basis points of negative foreign exchange impact, with new September quarter records in the Americas, Europe, Greater China and rest of Asia Pacific. Importantly, in constant currency, we grew nicely in each of our geographic segments, with strong double-digit growth outside the US.\\r\\n\\r\\nProducts revenue was $71 billion, up 9% over last year despite FX headwinds and a record for the September quarter. And it was a September quarter revenue record for iPhone and Wearables, Home and Accessories and an all-time revenue record for Mac.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, our installed base of active devices continue to grow nicely. It reached an all-time high for all major product categories and geographic segments at the end of the quarter, thanks to extremely strong customer satisfaction and loyalty and a high number of customers that are new to our products.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur Services set a September quarter revenue record of $19.2 billion, up 5% over a year ago despite over 600 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange. We reached September quarter revenue records in the Americas, Europe, Greater China and rest of Asia Pacific and also in many Services categories, including all-time revenue records for cloud services and payment services.\\r\\n\\r\\nCompany gross margin was a September quarter record at 42.3%. It was down 100 basis points from last quarter due to unfavorable foreign exchange and a different mix, partially offset by leverage. Products gross margin was 34.6%, up 10 basis points sequentially, with improved leverage and favorable mix partially offset by foreign exchange. Services gross margin was 70.5%, down 100 basis points sequentially, primarily due to foreign exchange. Net income of $20.7 billion, diluted earnings per share of $1.29 and operating cash flow of $24.1 billion were all September quarter records.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me now get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue grew 10% year-over-year to a September quarter record of $42.6 billion, despite significant foreign exchange headwinds. We set September quarter records in the vast majority of markets we track, and our performance was particularly impressive in several large emerging markets, with India setting a new all-time revenue record and Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and Mexico more than doubling year-over-year.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks to our strong iPhone lineup, we set a quarterly record for upgraders and grew switchers double digits. This level of sales performance, along with unmatched customer loyalty, drove the active installed base of iPhones to a new all-time high across all geographic segments. And the latest survey of US consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction of 98%.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was a great quarter for Mac. We achieved an all-time revenue record of $11.5 billion, up 25% year-over-year, despite significant FX headwinds. There were three key items that helped drive this performance. First, we benefited from the launch of our new MacBook Air and MacBook Pro powered by the M2 chip. Second, we were able to satisfy pent-up demand that carried forward from the significant supply constraints we faced during the June quarter. Third, as our supply position improved, we were able to fill the channel.\\r\\n\\r\\nImportantly, our investment in the category has attracted both upgraders and customers new to Mac and helped our installed base reach an all-time high. In fact, we set a quarterly record for upgraders, while nearly half of customers buying Macs during the quarter were new to the device.\\r\\n\\r\\niPad revenue was $7.2 billion, down 13% year-over-year due to significant negative foreign exchange and a challenging compare due to the launch of new iPads a year ago. Despite this, the iPad installed base reached a new all-time high, thanks to incredible customer loyalty and a high number of new customers. In fact, over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product.\\r\\n\\r\\nWearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $9.7 billion, growing 10% year-over-year, driven by the launch of Apple Watch and new AirPods Pro. This level of safe performance along with very strong new tool rates, drove our installed base of devices in the category to a new all-time record. For instance, two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product.\\r\\n\\r\\nMoving to Services, as I mentioned, we set a September quarter record in aggregate and in most geographic segments, generating $19.2 billion in revenue in spite of very large foreign exchange headwinds.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is important to remember, that we achieved double-digit constant currency growth in Services on top of growing 26% during the September quarter a year ago. However, certain services were impacted by macroeconomic headwinds, including foreign exchange.\\r\\n\\r\\nDigital advertising and gaming are areas where we've seen some softness. Throughout the quarter, we continued to observe several trends that reflect the strength of our ecosystem and our long-term opportunity in the category.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst, our continued installed base growth across each geographic segment and each major product category represents a great foundation for future expansion of our ecosystem.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond, we saw increased customer engagement with our Services during the quarter. Both our transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits year-over-year, each setting a new all-time record. The percentage of accounts that pay for our services continues to increase, and we still see plenty of opportunity ahead of us.\\r\\n\\r\\nThird, paid subscriptions showed very strong growth. We now have more than 900 million paid subscriptions across the Services on our platform, up more than 155 million during the last 12 months alone and double what we had just three years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe continue investing in new content and features, across our service offerings. For example, we added several popular sports titles to Apple Arcade. We're also excited about our global partnership with Major League Soccer, where starting next season, fans can stream every single MLS match through the Apple TV app.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis momentum helped us achieve over $78 billion in Services revenue during fiscal 2022, a new record and up 14% year-over-year. We continue to invest confidently and believe strongly in the long-term potential of our Services business, which is already the size of a Fortune 50 business on its own, and has nearly doubled during the last four years.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was not only a record year for Services but also for our entire company. During the past four quarters, we grew our business by 8% or $29 billion, reaching more than $394 billion of revenue. We grew diluted earnings per share by 9% and generated over $111 billion of free cash flow, up 20% year-over-year.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt was also a strong year for our enterprise business, as we set new annual records for iPhone, iPad and Mac during fiscal 2022 and grew strong double-digits year-over-year as our devices and services continue to help more-and-more companies empower their employees and serve their customers.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor instance, Ford Manufacturing employees are using iPad and iPhone to help further improve the quality of its game-changing Ford F-150 Lightning electric trucks. iPhone's powerful A-series chip and advanced camera systems, along with third-party iOS apps, are enabling Ford to automate the visual quality inspection process in real-time to help address issues before they impact customers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd Cisco expanded its Macs as a choice program and is now offering it to all its employees to help attract and retain top talent. And when given this choice, employees have chosen Macs twice as often as other options.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn addition, many enterprise customers are taking advantage of the high residual value of our products and simple trade-in process to standardize the refresh cycles for their fleets of Apple devices. This allows employees to upgrade to the latest devices regularly while making it highly predictable and cost effective for the business.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet me now turn to our cash position. Our business continues to generate very strong cash flow, which enabled us to return over $29 billion to shareholders during the September quarter. This included $3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents and $25.2 billion through open market repurchases of 160 million Apple shares.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe ended the quarter with $169 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $2.8 billion in maturing debt and decreased commercial paper by $1 billion while issuing $5.5 billion of new debt, leaving us with total debt of $120 billion. As a result, net cash was $49 billion at the end of the quarter as we continue to make progress toward our goal of becoming net cash neutral over time.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we move ahead into the December quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term, we are not providing revenue guidance but we are sharing some directional insights based on the assumption that the macroeconomic outlook and COVID-related impacts to our business do not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall, we believe total company year-over-year revenue performance will decelerate during the December quarter as compared to the September quarter for a number of reasons. First, we expect nearly 10 percentage points of negative year-over-year impact from foreign exchange.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecond, on Mac, in addition to increasing FX headwinds, we have a very challenging compare against last year, which had the benefit of the launch and associated channel fill of our newly redesigned MacBook Pro with M1. Therefore, we expect Mac revenue to decline substantially year-over-year during the December quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\nSpecifically on Services, we expect to grow but to be impacted by the macroeconomic environment increasingly affecting foreign exchange, digital advertising and gaming. We expect gross margin to be between 42.5% and 43.5%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.7 billion and $14.9 billion.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe expect OI&E to be around negative $300 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16.5%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.23 per share of common stock, payable on November 10, 2022, to shareholders of record as of November 7, 2022.\\r\\n\\r\\nWith that, let's open the call to questions.\\r\\n\\r\\nTejas Gala\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we please have the first question?\\r\\n\\r\\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\\r\\n\\r\\nOperator\\r\\n\\r\\nWe'll go ahead and take our first question from Shannon Cross calling from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ – Shannon Cross\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you very much. It's great to talk to you on the call again. I'm wondering, can you just talk a bit about how you're thinking about this iPhone generation? On the positive side, you've raised prices. It seems to be mixing up. On the negative side, investors are concerned about impacted demand from the higher prices, what Huawei meant to you in prior years versus what could happen now. There are just some pressures out there. So I'm curious if you can kind of talk to what you're seeing initially in iPhone demand and how you think it will move through. With the caveat that I understand, things are pretty uncertain out there. And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.\\r\\n\\r\\nTim Cook\\r\\n\\r\\nShannon, it's Tim. Welcome back. iPhone grew 10% in the Q4 timeframe to $42.6 billion. Customer demand was strong and better than we anticipated that it would be. And keep in mind that this is on top of a fiscal year of 2021 that had iPhone revenue grow by 39%, and so it's a tough compare as well. And so we were happy with it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn terms of the new products, the 14 and the 14 Pro and Pro Max, the -- it's still very early. But since the beginning, we've been constrained on the 14 Pro and the 14 Pro Max and we continue to be constrained today. And so we're working very hard to fulfill the demand. It's difficult to say what the mix will be until we can satisfy the demand because we don't really -- we're not able to determine the accurate mix until then. And so we -- but we're working very hard to do that.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe were really pleased with the broadness of the iPhone strength last quarter. We had three of the top four smartphones in the U.S. and the UK, the top three in Urban China, the top six in Australia, four out of the top five in Germany and the top two in Japan. And customer satisfaction for the iPhone remains very, very strong at 98%.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so we feel very good about how we performed in Q4. And certainly, the start of this generation would suggest that we're going to be constrained for a little while on the 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max. But we're working very hard to try to remedy that.\\r\\n\\r\\nShannon Cross\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you. And then, Luca, can you talk a bit about gross margin puts and takes? Just how we should think about, I mean, 10 basis points of currency this coming quarter is, I don't want to say unprecedented, but maybe it is. So I know you have hedges, but how do we think about it flowing through? And then what other -- components seem to be very favorable. But what else should we throw into the mix as we look forward?\\r\\n\\r\\nLuca Maestri\\r\\n\\r\\nYeah. Well, let me start with gross margin in Q4 and then I'll get to Q1. It was a September quarter record for the company. We did 42.3%, and that is in spite of, as you mentioned, very significant negative FX in -- for example, for Q4, on a sequential basis, FX was negative 70 basis points and on a year-over-year basis it was negative 170 basis points. Essentially every currency around the world has weakened against the dollar.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, we have guided Q1 to 42.5% to 43.5% in spite of the fact that we have, on a year-over-year basis, 330 basis points of negative exchange. Sequentially, it's 120 basis points unfavorable. So obviously, the strong dollar makes it difficult in a number of areas. Obviously, our pricing in emerging markets makes it difficult, and the translation of that revenue back into dollars is affected. But on the positive side, we are seeing commodities behave fairly favorably for us.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd so we believe we can offset the foreign exchange – the negative foreign exchange that we're seeing. And I think that the guidance that we provided reflects that. It takes into account, of course, FX. It takes into account some level of inflationary pressures. But I think the outcome is, I think, is a good one.\\r\\n\\r\\nShannon Cross\\r\\n\\r\\nGreat. Thank you very much.\\r\\n\\r\\nTejas Gala\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks, Shannon. Can we have the next question, please?\\r\\n\\r\\nOperator\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, sir. Our next question is coming from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir.\\r\\n\\r\\nErik Woodring\\r\\n\\r\\nHey, guys, thanks very much for taking my questions. I have two as well. Maybe if we could just start. Luca, we saw quite the divergence in iPad and Mac performance this quarter. Both were relatively constrained from a supply perspective. So maybe can you just elaborate on some of the most impacted -- important factors that contributed to kind of the divergence in performance and whether after we get through the December quarter, those can reverse or normalize? And then I have a follow-up.\\r\\n\\r\\nA – Tim Cook\\r\\n\\r\\nYeah, Erik, it's Tim. I'll take your question. On – if you look at the Mac, the Mac, it was the best quarter we've ever had in the history of the company. It was helped by the product launch of the MacBook Air with M2. It was helped that in the previous quarter, in the June quarter, if you remember, we lost output from the factory for a significant portion of the quarter. And so we had a backlog exiting our Q3 headed into Q4. We were able to satisfy all of that demand during Q4 and filled the channel for the Mac. And so that led to an incredible Mac quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you look at iPad, iPad had sort of the opposite happening from a launch point of view. The comp from a year ago, we launched iPads in September. We launched iPads this year in October. The other point to remember is that the iPad Pro had just launched before the quarter started in the year-ago quarter so it was our first full quarter of iPad Pro. So it was an exceptionally strong iPad quarter a year ago, and the launches were really key to that performance. And so that's the reason iPad contracted during this quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\nErik Woodring\\r\\n\\r\\nOkay, that's helpful. Thank you, Tim. And then maybe, Luca, if I were just to ask you, obviously, Tejas at the beginning of the call talked about the 14-week quarter. Maybe can you just elaborate a little bit on how you think that 14-week quarter impacts different line items, whether it's products or certain segments within the product business or the Services stand-alone? Just where we should see that 14-week quarter provide a bit more of a tailwind versus maybe not have an impact at all? And that's it for me. Thanks.\\r\\n\\r\\nLuca Maestri\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, we have a few more days in the quarter that we're going to -- are going to affect both our revenues and our costs. Not every week is equal because obviously, we have certain peaks during the course of the quarter.\\r\\n\\r\\nThink about Black Friday or the Christmas holiday. But, in general, we're adding a few days of sale and additional OpEx as well on the cost front. So that's what happens to us every approximately six years as we need to align our weekly calendar to the fiscal calendar.\\r\\n\\r\\nErik Woodring\\r\\n\\r\\nSuper. Thanks, guys.\\r\\n\\r\\nTejas Gala\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks, Erik. Can we have the next question, please?\\r\\n\\r\\nOperator\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, sir. The next question is coming from Ben Bollin calling from Cleveland Research.\\r\\n\\r\\nBen Bollin\\r\\n\\r\\nGood afternoon, everyone. Thank you for taking the question. Tim, I was hoping we could talk a little bit about services, pieces within the portfolio. It looks like there's been some price adjustments as of late with respect to Music, TV+ and the One bundle. I'm curious how you think about balancing the consumer price versus your own costs and kind of the associated follow-through. And then I have a follow-up.\\r\\n\\r\\nTim Cook\\r\\n\\r\\nYes. If you look at the price increase that you referenced, Ben, on Monday of this week, we announced a price increase on Apple Music and on Apple TV+ and then the corresponding Apple One, that is the consolidated bundle that includes both of those.\\r\\n\\r\\nOn -- there's really two different situations here. With Music, the cost of licensing increased. And so we are paying more for music. The good thing about that is the artist will also get more money for their songs that are enjoyed on streaming. And so there's some bit of good news there, I suppose.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd then on Apple TV+, if you look at when we first priced it, we only had a very few shows. We were at the beginning. We are very focused on originals only, and so we had four or five shows or so in the beginning and priced it quite low.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe now have a lot more content and are coming out on -- with more each and every month. And so, we've increased the price to represent the value of the service. And of course, Apple One is just the consolidation of those two price changes.\\r\\n\\r\\nBen Bollin\\r\\n\\r\\nOkay. And then, another item. Any preliminary thoughts around capital intensity into fiscal 2023? Last couple of years, CapEx has been relatively stable. Can you talk to the big constituents of the CapEx figure and maybe any moving pieces and how we could think about that to 2023? Thank you.\\r\\n\\r\\nLuca Maestri\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, Ben. So when we look at our CapEx, as you correctly said, I mean, we've been fairly stable, and I think our capital intensity is really very good. We have three major buckets in CapEx for the company. We have certain dedicated tools for the manufacturing facilities. We had some spend around data centers, and we have spend around our office facilities around the world. We obviously monitor all of them. There is nothing unusual that we see for the next 12 months.\\r\\n\\r\\nBen Bollin\\r\\n\\r\\nOkay. Thanks, guys.\\r\\n\\r\\nTejas Gala\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks, Ben. Can we have our next question, please\\r\\n\\r\\nOperator\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, sir. Our next question is coming from Kyle McNealy calling from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nKyle McNealy\\r\\n\\r\\nHi, thanks very much. Just wanted to see if you could give us a sense for what drove the Wearables result and the strength there this quarter. Was it from the maybe strong iPhone attach rates or the new products that you have available that were announced this quarter, or maybe you're still getting some benefit from customers that are more willing to come into the store now and try things on versus the pandemic when that was kind of shut down?\\r\\n\\r\\nTim Cook\\r\\n\\r\\nYes. Kyle, it's Tim. The -- if you look at Wearables, we grew 10%, which we were very happy with. If you look at the individual pieces of that, Apple Watch was a contributor. And in particular, the new lineup was a contributor, including the Apple Watch Ultra and the Apple Watch Series 8 and the SE. The Ultra is -- was supply constrained and continues to be supply constrained during this quarter thus far. And so we're working hard to satisfy the demand bearing, get those products to customers.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also announced and launched the AirPods Pro in September. And the reviews for the product have just been off the charts in terms of the noise cancellation features and the sound quality. We're getting great, great reviews from there. In terms of what played the other way, the headwinds, obviously, FX was a headwind that affected Wearables, Home and Accessories, just like it affected the rest of our products and services. And we also had effect from the business in Russia, obviously, or the impact there. So that's sort of the pro and the con.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other thing that I should mention is that about two-thirds of the Apple Watches that we sold were to customers that had not previously owned an Apple Watch. And so the -- we're still very much selling to new customers here, which is very, very good for the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nKyle McNealy\\r\\n\\r\\nOkay, great. One more quick one on Mac. I wanted to see if you could quantify at all how much the channel fill and how much came from satisfying back orders from the June period for Mac. We're just trying to get a sense for where the baseline is, if there's any sense you can give us on that. What would it have grown if not for those factors? Anything you can give us would be great. Thanks.\\r\\n\\r\\nTim Cook\\r\\n\\r\\nYes. I would just say that all three of the reasons that I gave were key in achieving the 25%. The M2 MacBook Air, the launch of the new product, the -- satisfying the back orders from the previous quarter and then filling the channel, all of those were key contributors.\\r\\n\\r\\nKyle McNealy\\r\\n\\r\\nOkay, Tim. Thanks.\\r\\n\\r\\nTejas Gala\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks, Kyle. Can we have our next question, please\\r\\n\\r\\nOperator\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, sir. The next question is coming from Mr. Jim Suva calling from Citigroup.\\r\\n\\r\\nJim Suva\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you and it's great to see that you talked about your suppliers going carbon-neutral, something -- a small statement I really took to heart. Thank you. My question is on the Services. Could it possibly be impacted more by FX than product, meaning the Jim Suva family has Apple One and TV+ and all that, and we pay typically on annual, but then when we go into the store to buy new Watches and iPad, the price is adjusted more quickly. So could it be that Services growth was impacted a little bit more by FX and down the road, we could see growth reaccelerate, or am I just reading too much into the FX impact that could be different from Services versus product? Thank you.\\r\\n\\r\\nLuca Maestri\\r\\n\\r\\nJim, it's Luca. No, you're right. Obviously, the FX impact on our business depends on the geographic mix of the sales that we do. And so yes, it can be -- Services and products can have slightly different effects on foreign exchange. And so, if we look at our Services business in constant currency, we would have grown double digits. And so we're very pleased with that.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs I mentioned, there were some areas that we could see some softness in digital advertising. Of course, you know that part, and gaming on the App Store was affected. But we were very happy with what we saw in terms of the behavior of our customers with the engagement with Services. And I mentioned a number of things during the prepared remarks, the fact that, obviously, that installed base is growing, that's a positive and it's a great foundation for the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are seeing more transacting accounts and more paid accounts, they're both growing double digits. Paid accounts are growing faster than transacting accounts, so the penetration of paid accounts is increasing. We have a great subscription business, 900 million paid subs now on the platform and growing very fast. We doubled in 3 years. So when we look at all those dynamics, that's the part that is really interesting to us because we really believe that the engine for Services growth is there and foreign exchange is a temporary thing and – but the fundamentals are very good.\\r\\n\\r\\nJim Suva\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you. Congratulations for your team.\\r\\n\\r\\nTejas Gala\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks Jim. Can we have the next question, please.\\r\\n\\r\\nOperator\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next question is coming from Amit Daryanani from Evercore. Please go ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmit Daryanani\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks for taking my question. I have 2 as well. The first 1 really is around the iPhone trajectory. There's been a fair amount of focus in terms of what's going to happen to iPhone demand, given the macro worries. It would be really helpful to understand though, given the strength you're seeing, where do you think channel inventory is for iPhones today versus where it would be from a historical perspective? And do you see the channel getting to an optimal level by end of December quarter? Because evenly right now given the lead time data, it looks like your revenue trajectory in iPhones is more driven by the supply you have versus demand. So any color on the channel inventory would be helpful.\\r\\n\\r\\nTim Cook\\r\\n\\r\\nYes. If you look at where we ended, Amit, in the September quarter, we exited below our target inventory range on iPhone and that's -- that in and of itself is not too unusual in the quarter. We start the ramp and demand is robust and so forth. And so I wouldn't call it that abnormal from the past.\\r\\n\\r\\nQ –\\r\\n\\r\\nGot it. And then I guess, Tim, you folks have been talking about digital advertising a fair bit over the last few quarters, I think. Is there any metrics, any vectors you can talk about kind of to give us a sense of how big those businesses or what vectors are you focused on? And really, if you could talk about, do you think Apple can build an advertising business at scale without sacrificing consumer privacy?\\r\\n\\r\\nTim Cook\\r\\n\\r\\nSo our -- first and foremost, we focus on privacy and so we would not do anything that stepped away from that. We feel that privacy is a basic fundamental human right, and so that's sort of the lens that we look at it under. Our specific advertising business is not large and relative to others and so forth. But we don't release the exact numbers on it, but it's clearly not large.\\r\\n\\r\\nTejas Gala\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks, Amit. Can we have the next question, please.\\r\\n\\r\\nOperator\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, sir. We'll now move on to Mr. Harsh Kumar calling from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarsh Kumar\\r\\n\\r\\nYeah. Hey, thanks guys, First of all, fellows congratulations on stellar performance. There's a lot of large-cap companies that are getting ripped around, so we appreciate the steady cadence here. Tim, I wanted to ask you about inflation pressures and labor problems here in the US and globally. And maybe talk about what steps can Apple take to mitigate those? And maybe Luca, on that end, FX is becoming a pretty significant headwind. I was curious what -- if at all, if there's anything that can be done to mitigate that.\\r\\n\\r\\nTim Cook\\r\\n\\r\\nI'll let Luca talk about FX. In terms of the people piece, we're focused on taking care of our teams and offering them the best benefits and best compensation so that we can empower them to do the best work of their lives. And so that's what we're focused on in terms of our teams.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn terms of inflation, there's clearly wage inflation. There's inflation related to logistics as well. If you compare it to pre-pandemic kind of levels, that has not returned to pre pandemic levels by any means.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd there's certain silicon components that are -- have inflationary pressure as well. And so that's not an all-inclusive list of where we see it, but it gives you some ingredients of where we see inflation pressure. And we've obviously taken that into consideration in the gross margin guidance that Luca gave earlier in the call.\\r\\n\\r\\nLuca Maestri\\r\\n\\r\\nYes. And on foreign exchange, you're right. I mean, it's obviously a very significant factor that is affecting our results, both revenue and gross margin. What do we do about situation like this, one where we have a very strong dollar? Of course, we hedge our exposures. We try to hedge them in as many places as possible around the world. For example, I think we've been probably the first company that started hedging our exposure in China several years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere may be a few currency, small ones, where we don't hedge because the cost is prohibitive or the market is not there. But in general, we tend to hedge because it gives us significant level of margin stability. Obviously, over time, that protection reduces because the hedges roll over and we need to buy new contracts. But that's the primary tool that we use to offset some of the FX pressure.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, when we launch new products, in particular, we look at the FX situation. And in some cases, for example, customers in international markets had to -- they saw some price increases when we launched the new products, which is not something that, for example, US customers have seen. And that's unfortunately the situation that we're in right now with the strong dollar. So that's the way we try to deal with that.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have to say that one of the things that we've really appreciated the most during the quarter was the fact that in spite of this very strong dollar and the difficult FX environment, we have seen very strong performance in many international markets, particularly some very large emerging markets where even in reported currencies, so in US dollars, we're seeing very strong double-digit growth in places like India, Indonesia, Mexico, Vietnam, many places where we've done incredibly well. And obviously, in local currency, those growth rates are even higher.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt's important for us to look at how these markets perform in local currency because it really gives us a good sense for the customer response to our products, the engagement with our ecosystem and in general, the strength of the brand. And I have to say, in that respect, we feel very, very good about the progress that we're making in a lot of markets around the world.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarsh Kumar\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks, Tim and Luca. I had a follow-up. Luca, in your prepared remarks for the guidance, you mentioned that for the December quarter, you expect the performance to decelerate relative to September. So September was a year-over-year about, call it, 8%. Should I think that, that 8% number will go down on a year-over-year basis as we look at December? Maybe you could provide some color on what you're thinking. And are we still looking -- are we looking at a positive number, or are we thinking maybe that the growth rate will be negative on a year-over-year basis?\\r\\n\\r\\nLuca Maestri\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat we said is that we're going to be decelerating from September, so September was 8%, so it's going to be a lower percentage than 8%. We're not providing guidance for the reasons that we've explained. There's a lot of uncertainty there. And so we see how the quarter progresses. Keep in mind the 10 points of exchange. Certainly, in normal times, we will be talking about very different numbers, but that's where we are right now.\\r\\n\\r\\nHarsh Kumar\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you guys.\\r\\n\\r\\nTejas Gala\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks, Harsh. Can we have the next question please.\\r\\n\\r\\nOperator\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, sir. Next question is coming from Krish Sankar calling from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nKrish Sankar\\r\\n\\r\\nYeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I had two of them. First one, either for Tim or Luca, on cash and capital allocation. Given there's some correction and valuation for some of the private and public companies, does it change your thought process on the time line to get to cash-neutral? In other words, would you be more aggressive with acquisitions, or you think holding on to more cash due to interest income becomes more attractive versus your prior investment goals? And then I had a quick follow-up.\\r\\n\\r\\nTim Cook\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is Tim. In terms of acquisitions, we averaged about one per month, I believe, in across fiscal year 2022. And so we're constantly looking in the market. And what's out there. And what things would be synergistic. And which things would provide either intellectual property or talent or preferably both that we would need. And so we're constantly looking at acquisitions of all sizes.\\r\\n\\r\\nLuca Maestri\\r\\n\\r\\nIn terms of cash deployment, obviously, we like to look at the capital return program over the long arc of time. And we have done, since the beginning of the program we've done over $550 billion of buyback at an average repurchase price of $47. So the program has been incredibly successful.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are still in a position where we have net cash. And we said all along, we want to get to cash-neutral at some point. Our cash generation has been very, very strong over the years, particularly last year. I think, I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we did $111 billion of free cash flow. That's up 20% year-over-year. And so we will put that capital to use for investors.\\r\\n\\r\\nKrish Sankar\\r\\n\\r\\nGot it, got it, very helpful, Tim and Luca. And then a quick follow-up for Luca on the December guidance, thanks for the color on that. I'm just kind of curious, the extra week in the quarter, is that not helping offset some of the FX, or in other words, the 10 percentage point negative impact from FX will be much higher if that's a 13-week quarter?\\r\\n\\r\\nLuca Maestri\\r\\n\\r\\nNo, I wouldn't say that because those are percentages. So yeah, no, the 10 points wouldn't be different. 13 or 14 weeks would be the same.\\r\\n\\r\\nKrish Sankar\\r\\n\\r\\nGot it. Got it. Thanks a lot Luca.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnd of Q&A\\r\\n\\r\\nTejas Gala\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you, Krish.

              "\"Operator\\n\\nGood afternoon. My name is Emma, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the NVIDIA's third quarter earnings call. [Operator instructions] Simona Jankowski, you may begin your conference.\\n\\nSimona Jankowski -- Vice President, Investor Relations\\n\\nThank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to NVIDIA's conference call for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. With me today from NVIDIA are Jen-Hsun Huang, president and chief executive officer; and Colette Kress, executive vice president and chief financial officer. I'd like to remind you that our call is being webcast live on NVIDIA's investor relations website.\\n\\n\\nThe webcast will be available for replay until the conference call to discuss our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2023. The content of today's call is NVIDIA's property. It can't be reproduced or transcribed without our prior written consent. During this call, we may make forward-looking statements based on current expectations.\\n\\nThese are subject to a number of significant risks and uncertainties, and our actual results may differ materially. For a discussion of factors that could affect our future financial results and business, please refer to the disclosure in today's earnings release our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q and the reports that we may file on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All our statements are made as of today, November 16, 2022, and based on information currently available to us. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update any such statements.\\n\\nDuring this call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures in our CFO commentary, which is posted on our website. With that, let me turn the call over to Colette.\\n\\nColette Kress -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\\n\\n\\nThanks, Simona. Q3 revenue was $5.93 billion, down 12% sequentially and down 17% year on year. We delivered record data center and automotive revenue. while our gaming and pro visualization platforms declined as we work through channel inventory corrections and challenging external conditions.\\n\\nStarting with data center. Revenue of $3.83 billion was up 1% sequentially and 31% year-on-year. This reflects very solid performance in the face of macroeconomic challenges new export controls and lingering supply chain disruptions. Year-on-year growth was driven primarily by leading U.S.\\n\\ncloud providers and a broadening set of consumer Internet companies for workloads such as large language models, recommendation systems and generative AI. As the number and scale of public cloud computing and Internet service companies deploying NVIDIA AI grows our traditional hyperscale definition will need to be expanded to convey the different end market use cases. We will align our data center customer commentary going forward accordingly. Other vertical industries, such as automotive and energy, also contributed to growth with key workloads relating to autonomous driving, high-performance computing, simulations and analytics.\\n\\nDuring the quarter, the U.S. government announced new restrictions impacting exports of our A100 and H-100 based products to China, and any product destined for certain systems or entities in China. These restrictions impacted third quarter revenue, largely offset by sales of alternative products into China. That said, demand in China more broadly remains soft, and we expect that to continue in the current quarter.\\n\\n\\nWe started shipping our flagship 100 data center GPU based on the new hopper architecture in Q3. A100-based systems are available starting this month from leading server makers including Dell, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Lenovo and SuperMicro. Early next year, the first H-100 based cloud instances will be available on Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. A100 delivered the highest performance and workload versatility for both AI training and inference in the latest MLPerf industry benchmarks.\\n\\nH-100 also delivers incredible value compared to the previous generation for equivalent AI performance it offers three x lower total cost of ownership while using five x fewer server nodes and 3.5 x less energy. Earlier today, we announced a multiyear collaboration with Microsoft to build an advanced cloud-based AI supercomputer to help enterprises train, deploy and scale AI including large state-of-the-art models. MacBook Azure will incorporate our complete AI stack, adding tens and thousands of A100 and A100 GPUs. Quantum 2 400 gigabit per second InfiniBand networking and the NVIDIA AI enterprise software suite to its platform.\\n\\nOracle and NVIDIA are also working together to offer AI training and inference at scale to thousands of enterprises. This includes bringing to Oracle Cloud infrastructure, the full NVIDIA accelerated computing stack and adding tens of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs, including the A100 and H-100. Cloud-based high-performance in the company, new scale is adopting NVIDIA AI enterprise and other software to address the industrial scientific communities, rising demand for AI in the cloud. NVIDIA AI will bring new capability to rescale high-performance computing as a service offerings, which include simulation and engineering software used across industries.\\n\\nNetworking posted strong growth driven by hyperscale customers and easing supply constraints. -- our new Quantum 240 gigabit per second InfiniBand and Spectrum Ethernet networking platforms are building momentum. We achieved an important milestone this quarter with VMware. And whose leading server virtualization platform, vSphere, has been rearchitected over the last two years to run on DPUs and now supports our BlueField DPUs.\\n\\nOur joint enterprise AI platform is available first on Dell PowerEdge servers. The BlueField DPU design win pipeline is growing and the number of infrastructure softer partners is expanding, including Arista, Check Point, Juniper, [Inaudible] Networks and Red Hot. The latest top 500 list of supercomputers released this week at Supercomputing '22 and has the highest ever number of NVIDIA-powered systems, including 72% of the total and 90% of new systems on the list. Moreover, NVIDIA powers 23 of the top 30 of the Green 500 list, demonstrating the energy efficiency of accelerated computing.\\n\\nThe No. 1 most energy-efficient system is the Flat Iron Institute Henry, which is the first top 500 system featuring our H-100 GPUs. At GTC, we announced the NVIDIA Omniverse Computing System, or OVS, reference designs featuring the new L4 GPU based on the ADA Lovelace architecture. These systems are designed to build and operate 3D virtual world using NVIDIA Omniverse enterprise.\\n\\nNVIDIA OBX systems will be available from Inspur, Lenovo and Super Micro by early 2023. We Lockheed Martin and Jaguar Land Rover will be among the first customers to receive OVS systems. We are further expanding our AI software and services offerings with NVIDIA and Bio Nemo large language model services, which are both entering early access this month. These enable developers to easily adopt large language models and deploy customized AI applications for content generation, tech summarization, chatbox, co-development, protein structure and biomolecular property predictions.\\n\\nMoving to gaming. Revenue of $1.57 billion was down 23% sequentially and down 51% from a year ago, reflecting lower sell-in to partners to help align channel inventory levels with current demand expectations. We believe Channel inventories are on track to approach normal levels as we exit Q4. Sell-through for our gaming products was relatively solid in the Americas and EMEA and but softer in Asia Pac as macroeconomic conditions and covered lockdowns in China continued to weigh on consumer demand.\\n\\nOur new Ada Lovelace GPU architecture had an exceptional launch. The first ADA GPU, the GeForce RTX 4090 became available in mid-October and a tremendous amount and positive feedback from the gaming community. We sold out quickly in many locations and are working hard to keep up with demand. The next member of the ATA family, RTX 4080 is available today.\\n\\nThe RTX 40 Series GPUs features DLSS 3, the neuro rendering technology that uses AI to generate entire frames for faster game play. Our third-generation RTX technology has raised the bar for computer graphics and help supercharge gaming. For example, the 15-year old classic game portal, now reimagined with full ray tracing and DLSS 3 has made it on Steam's top 100 most wish-listed gains. The total number of RTX games and applications now exceeds 350.\\n\\nThere is tremendous energy in the gaming community that we believe will continue to fuel strong fundamentals over the long term. The number of simultaneous users on steam just hit a record of $30 million, surpassing the prior peak of $28 million in January. Activision's Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 set a record for the franchise with more than $800 million in opening weekend sales. topping the combined box office openings of movie blockbusters, TopGun Maverick and Dr.\\n\\nStrains in the Multiverse of [Inaudible]. And this month's League of Legends World Championship in San Francisco sold out minutes with 18,000 esports fans packed the arena where the Golden State Warriors play. We continue to expand the GeForce NOW cloud gaming service. In Q3, we added over 85 games to the library, bringing the total to over 1,400.\\n\\nWe also launched GeForce now on the new gaming devices, including Logitech, Cloud handheld, cloud gaming Chromebooks and Razor 5G Edge. Moving to Probi Revenue of $200 million was down 60% sequentially and down 65% from a year ago, reflecting lower sell-in to partners to help align channel inventory levels with the current demand expectations. These dynamics are expected to continue in Q4. Despite near-term challenges, we believe our long-term opportunity remains intact, fueled by AI simulation, computationally intensive design and engineering workloads.\\n\\nAt GTC, we announced NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud Services, our first software and infrastructure as a service offering, enabling artists, developers and enterprise teams to design, publish and operate metaverse applications from anywhere on any device. Omniverse Cloud Services runs on Omniverse cloud computer, a computing system comprised of NVIDIA OBX for graphics and physics simulation. NVIDIA HDX for AI workloads and the NVIDIA graphics delivery network, a global scale, distributed data center network for delivering low-latency metaverse graphics on the edge. Leaders in some of the world's largest industries continue to adopt Omniverse.\\n\\nHome improvement retailer, Lowe's is using it to help design, build and operate digital twins for their stores. Charter Communications and advanced analytics company, heavy AI are creating Omniverse power digital twins to optimize Charter's wireless network. In Deutsche Bahn, operator of German National Railway is using Omniverse to create digital twins of its rail network and train AI models to monitor the network, increasing safety and reliability. Moving to automotive.\\n\\nRevenue of $251 million, increased 14% sequentially and 86% from a year ago. Growth was driven by an increase in AI automotive solutions as our customers drive or on-based production ramp, continue to scale. Automotive has great momentum and is on its way to be our next multibillion-dollar platform. Global cars unveiled the all-new flagship Volvo EX90 SUV powered by the NVIDIA Drive platform.\\n\\nThis is the first model to use Volvo's software-defined architecture with a centralized core computer containing both drive Orin and DRIVEXaviar, along with 30 sensors. Other recently announced design wins and new model introductions include ton, auto, Neo, Polystar and [Inaudible]. At GTC, we also announced that NVIDIA Drive Super Chip, the successor to Orin in our automotive SoC road map, drive [Inaudible] delivers up to 2,000 tariff lots of performance and leverages technologies introduced in our Grace Hopper and ADA architectures. It is capable of running both the automated drive and in-vehicle infotainment systems.\\n\\nSimultaneously offering a LIFA performance while reducing cost and energy consumption. Driver will be available for automakers 25 models with Geely owned automaker, Zika as the first announced customer. Moving to the rest of the P&L. GAAP gross margin was 53.6% and and non-GAAP gross margin was 56.1%.\\n\\nGross margins reflect $702 million in inventory charges largely related to lower data center demand in China, partially offset by a warranty benefit of approximately $70 million. Year-on-year, GAAP operating expenses were up 31%, and non-GAAP operating expenses were up 30%, primarily due to higher compensation expenses related to headcount growth and salary increases and higher data center infrastructure expenses. Sequentially, both GAAP and non-GAAP operating expense growth was in the single-digit percent, and we plan to keep it relatively flat at these levels over the coming quarters. We returned $3.75 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends.\\n\\nAt the end of Q3, we had approximately $8.3 billion remaining under our share repurchase authorization through December 23. Let me turn to the outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. We expect our data center revenue to reflect early production shipments of the A100, offset by continued softness in China. In gaming, we expect to resume sequential growth with our revenue still below end demand as we continue to work through the channel inventory correction.\\n\\nAnd in automotive, we expect the continued ramp of our Oren design wins. All in, we expect modest sequential growth driven by automotive, gaming and data center. Revenue is expected to be $6 billion, plus or minus 2%. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be $63.2 million and 66%, respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points.\\n\\nGAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $2.56 billion. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately $1.78 billion. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be an income of approximately $40 million, excluding gains and losses on nonaffiliated investments. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected to be 9%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items.\\n\\nCapital expenditures are expected to be approximately $500 million to $550 million. Further financial details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on our IR website. In closing, let me highlight upcoming events for the financial community. We'll be attending the Credit Suisse conference in Phoenix on November 30.\\n\\nThe rate Virtual Tech Conference on December 5 and and the JPMorgan Forum on January 5 in Las Vegas. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our fourth quarter and fiscal 2023 are scheduled for Wednesday, February 22. We will now open the call for questions. Operator, could you please poll for questions?\\n\\nQuestions & Answers:\\nOperator\\n\\n[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Your line is now open.\\n\\nVivek Arya -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\\n\\nThanks for taking my question. Colette, just wanted to clarify first, I think last quarter, you gave us a sell-through rate for your gaming business at about $2.5 billion a quarter. I think you said China is somewhat weaker. So I was hoping you could update us on what that sell-through rate is right now for gaming.\\n\\nAnd then, Jen-Hsun, the question for you. A lot of concerns about large hyperscalers cutting their spending and pointing to a slowdown. So if, let's say, U.S. cloud capex is flat or slightly down next year, do you think your business can still grow in the data center and why?\\n\\nColette Kress -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYes. Thanks for the question. Let me first start with the sell-through on our gaming business. we had indicated, if you put two quarters together, we would see approximately $5 billion in normalized sell-through for our business.\\n\\nNow, during the quarter, sell-through in Q3 three was relatively solid. We've indicated that although China lockdowns continue to channel -- excuse me, challenge our overall China business. It was still relatively solid. Notebook sell-through was also quite solid.\\n\\nAnd desktop, a bit softer, particularly in that China and Asia areas. We expect though stronger end demand, though, as we enter into Q4, driven by the upcoming holidays, as well as the continuation of the ADA adoption.\\n\\nJen-Hsun Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nVivek, our data center business is indexed to two fundamental dynamics. The first has to do with general purpose computing no longer scaling. And so, acceleration is necessary to achieve the necessary level of cost efficiency scale and energy efficiency scale so that we can continue to increase workloads while saving money and saving power. Accelerated computing is recognized generally as the path forward as general purpose computing slows.\\n\\nThe second dynamic is AI. And we're seeing surging demand in some very important sectors of AIs in important breakthroughs in AI. One is called deep recommender systems, which is quite essential now to the best content or item or product to recommend to somebody who's using a device that is like a selfie or interacting with a computer just using voice. You need to really understand the nature, the context of the person making the request and make the appropriate recommendation to them.\\n\\nThe second has to do with large language models. This is -- this started several years ago with the invention of the transformer, which led to Bert, which led to GP3, which led to a whole bunch of other models now associated with that. We now have the ability to learn representations of languages of all kinds. It could be human language.\\n\\nIt could be the language of biology. It could be the language of chemistry. And recently, I just saw a breakthrough called Jeans LM, we just one of the first example of learning the language of human genomes. The third has to do with generative AI.\\n\\nYou know that the first 10 years, we've dedicated ourselves to perception AI. But the goal of perception, of course, is to understand context. But the ultimate goal of AI is to make a contribution to create something to generate product. And this is now the beginning of the era of generative AI.\\n\\nYou probably see it all over the place, whether they're generating images or generating videos or generating text of all kinds and the ability to augment our performance to enhance our performance to make productivity enhanced to reduce cost and improve whatever we do with whatever we have to work with, productivity is really more important than ever. And so, you could see that our company is indexed to two things, both of which are more important than ever, which is power efficiency, cost efficiency and then, of course, productivity. And these things are more important than ever. And my expectation is that we're seeing all the strong demand and surging demand for AI and for niche reasons.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nYour next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore. Your line is now open.\\n\\nC.J. Muse -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\\n\\nYeah, Good afternoon and thank you for taking the question. You started to bundle on NVIDIA enterprise now with the H-100. I'm curious if you can talk about how we should think about timing around software monetization? And how we should kind of see this flow through the model, particularly with the focus on the AI enterprise and Omnivere side of things?\\n\\nJen-Hsun Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYes. Thanks, CJ. We're making excellent progress in NVIDIA AI enterprise. In fact, you saw probably that we made several announcements this quarter associated with clouds.\\n\\nYou know that NVIDIA has a rich ecosystem. And over the years, our rich ecosystem and our software stack has been integrated into developers and start-ups of all kinds, but more so -- more than ever, we're at the tipping point of clouds, and that's fantastic. Because if we could get NVIDIA's architecture and our full stack into every single cloud, we could reach more customers more quickly. And this quarter, we announced several initiatives, one has several partnerships and collaborations, one that we announced today, which has to do with Microsoft and our partnership there.\\n\\nIt has everything to do with scaling up AI because we have so many start-ups clamoring for large installations of our GPU so that they could do large language model training and building their start-ups and scale out of AI to enterprise and all of the world's Internet service providers. Every company we're talking to would like to have the agility and the scale, flexibility of clouds. And so, over the last year or so, we've been working on moving all of our software stacks to the cloud are of our platform and software stacks to the cloud. And so, today, we announced that Microsoft and ourselves are going to standardize on the NVIDIA stack, for a very large part of the work that we're doing together so that we could take a full stack out to the world's enterprise.\\n\\nThat's all software included. We, a month ago, announced the same similar type of partnership with Oracle. You also saw that rescale a leader in high-performance computing cloud has integrated NVIDIA AI into their stack. [Inaudible] has been integrated into GCP.\\n\\nAnd we announced recently Nemo, large language model and bionemo large language model to put NVIDIA software in the cloud. And we also announced Omniverse is now available in the cloud. The goal of all of this is to move the NVIDIA platform full stack off boarding the cloud so that we can engage customers much, much more quickly and customers could engage our software if they would like to use it in the cloud, it's per GPU instance hour if they would like to utilize our software on-prem, they could do it through software license. And so, license and subscription.\\n\\nAnd so, in both cases, we now have software available practically everywhere you would like to engage it. The partners that we work with are super excited about it because MBDA's rich ecosystem is global, and this could bring both new consumption into their cloud for both them and ourselves, but also connect all of these new opportunities to the other APIs and other services that they offer. And so, our software stack is making really great progress.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nYour next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\\n\\nChris Caso -- Credit Suisse -- Analyst\\n\\nYes. Thank you. Good evening. I wonder if you could give some more color about the inventory charges you took in the quarter and then internal inventory in general.\\n\\nIn the documentation, you talked about that being a portion of inventory on hand plus some purchase obligations. And you also spoke in your prepared remarks that some of this was due to China data centers. So if you can clarify what was in those charges. And then, in general, for your internal inventory.\\n\\nDoes that still need to be worked down? And what are the implications if that needs to be worked down over the next couple of quarters?\\n\\nColette Kress -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThanks for the question, Chris. So as we highlighted in our prepared remarks, we booked an entry of $702 million for inventory reserves within the quarter. Most of that, primarily, all of it is related to our data center business, just due to the change in expected demand looking forward for China. So when we look at the data center products, a good portion of this was also the A100, which we wrote down.\\n\\nNow, looking at our inventory that we have on hand and the inventory that has increased, a lot of that is just due to our upcoming architectures coming to market. our ADA architecture, our hopper architecture and even more in terms of our networking business. We have been building for those architectures to come to market and as such to say. We are always looking at our inventory levels at the end of each quarter for our expected demand going forward.\\n\\nBut I think we've done a solid job that we used in this quarter just based on that expectation going forward.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nYour next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open.\\n\\nTimothy Arcuri -- UBS -- Analyst\\n\\nThanks a lot. Colette, can you -- I have a two-part question. First, is there any effect of stockpiling in the data center guidance? I ask because you now have the A800 that is sort of a modified version of the A100 with the lower data transfer rate. So one could imagine that customers might be stocking that while they can still get it.\\n\\nAnd I guess the second part of that is related to the inventory charge, can you just go into that a little bit more? Because last quarter, it made sense that you took a charge because revenue was less than you thought, but revenue came in pretty much in line. And it sounded like China was a net neutral. So is the charge related to just working A100 inventory down faster? Is that what the charges related to?\\n\\nColette Kress -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nSure. So let me talk about the first statement that you indicated. Most of our data center business that we see is we're working with customers specifically on their needs to build out accelerated computing and AI. It's just not a business in terms of where units are being held for that.\\n\\nThey're usually four very, very specific products and projects that we see. So I'm going to answer no. Nothing that we can see. Your second question regarding the inventory provisions.\\n\\nAt the end of last quarter, we were beginning to see softness in China. We've always been looking at our needs long term. It's not a statement about the current quarter in inventory, as you can see. It usually takes two or three quarters for us to build product for the future demand.\\n\\nSo that's always a case of the inventory that we are ordering. So now looking at what we've seen in terms of continued lockdowns, continued economy challenges in China it was time for us to take a hard look of what do we think we'll need for data center going forward and not leg for write-downs.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nYour next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein. Your line is now open.\\n\\nStacy Rasgon -- AllianceBernstein -- Analyst\\n\\nHi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Colette, I had a question on the commentary you gave on the sequentials. It kind of sounded like data center maybe had some China softness issues.\\n\\nYou said gaming resumed sequential growth. But then you said sequential growth for the company driven by auto gaming and data center. How can all three of those grow sequentially if the overall guidance is kind of flattish? Are they all just like growing just a little bit? Or is one of them actually down? Like how do we think about the segments into Q4 given that commentary?\\n\\nColette Kress -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYes. So your question is regarding the sequentials from Q3 to our guidance that we provided for Q4. As we are seeing the numbers in terms of our guidance, you're correct, is only growing about $100 million. And we've indicated that three of those platforms will likely grow just a little bit.\\n\\nBut our pro visualization business we think is going to be flattish and likely not growing as we're still working on correcting the channel inventory levels. to get to the right amount. It's very difficult to say which will have that increase. But again, we are planning for all three of those different market platforms to grow just a little bit.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Your line is now open.\\n\\nMark Lipacis -- Jefferies -- Analyst\\n\\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. Jen-Hsun, I think for you, you've articulated a vision for the data center we're a solution with an integrated solution set of a CPU, GPU and DPU is deployed for all workloads or most workloads, I think. Could you just give us a sense of or talk about where is this vision in the penetration cycle? And maybe talk about Grace Grace's importance for realizing that vision, what will Grace deliver versus an off-the-shelf x86 where -- do you have a sense of where Grace will get embraced first or the fastest within that vision?\\n\\nJen-Hsun Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nGrace's data moving capability is off the charts. Grace also is memory coherent to our GPU, which allows our GPU to expand its effective GPU memory, fast GPU memory by a factor of 10. That's not possible without special capabilities that are designed between hopper and Grace and the architecture of Grace. And so, it was designed.\\n\\nGrace is designed for very large data processing at very high speeds. Those applications are related to, for example, data processing is related for recommender systems, which operates on petabytes of live data at a time. It's all hot. It all needs to be fast, so that you can make a recommendation within milliseconds to hundreds of millions of people using our service.\\n\\nIt is also quite effective at AI training, machine learning. And so, those kind of applications are really terrific. We -- Grace, I think I've said before that we will have production samples in Q1, and we're still on track to do that.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nYour next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.\\n\\nHarlan Sur -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\\n\\nGood afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Your data center networking business, I believe, is driving about $800 million per quarter in sales, very, very strong growth over the past few years. Near term, as you guys pointed out, and the team is driving strong Nick and blue food attached to your own compute solutions like DGX and more partner announcements like VMware, but we also know that networking has pretty large exposure to general purpose cloud and hyperscale compute spending trends. So what's the visibility and growth outlook for the networking business over the next few quarters?\\n\\nJen-Hsun Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYes. If I could take that. First, thanks for your question. Our networking, as you know, is heavily indexed to high-performance computing.\\n\\nWe're not -- we don't serve the vast majority of commodity networking. All of our network solutions are very high end, and they're designed for data centers that move a lot of data. Now, if you have a hyperscale data center these days, and you are deploying a large number of AI applications. It is very likely that the network bandwidth that you provision has a substantial implication on the overall throughput of your data center.\\n\\nSo the small incremental investment they make in high-performance networking translates to billions of dollars of savings slightly in provisioning the service or billions of dollars more throughput, which increases their economics. And so, these days, with disaggregated and I application, AI provisioning and data centers, high-performance networking is really quite fantastic and it pays for itself right away. But that's where we are focused in high-performance networking and provisioning AI services in -- well, the AI applications that we focus on. You might have noticed that NVIDIA and Microsoft are building one of the largest AI infrastructures in the world.\\n\\nAnd it is completely powered by NVIDIA's InfiniBand 400 gigabits per second network. And the reason for that is because that network pays for itself instantaneously. The investment that you're going to put into the infrastructure is so significant that if you were to be dragged by slow networks, obviously, the efficiency of the overall infrastructure is not as high. And so, in the places where we focus networking is really quite important.\\n\\nIt goes all the way back to when we first announced the acquisition of Mellanox. I think at the time, they were doing about a few hundred million dollars a quarter, about $400 million a quarter. And now we're doing what they used to do in the old days, in a year, practically coming up in a quarter. And so, that kind of tells you about the growth of high-performance networking.\\n\\nIt is an indexed to overall enterprise and data center spend but it is highly indexed to AI adoption.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nYour next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\\n\\nAaron Rakers -- Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst\\n\\nThanks for taking the question. I want to expand on the networking question a little bit further. When we look at the Microsoft announcement today, we think about what Meda is doing on the AI footprint that they're deploying. Jen-Hsun, can you help us understand like where your InfiniBand networking sits relative to like traditional data center switching? And maybe kind of build on that, how you're positioning spectrum for in the market, does that compete against a broader set of opportunities in the Ethernet world for AI fabric networking?\\n\\nJen-Hsun Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYes. Thanks, Erin. The math is like this. If you're going to spend $20 billion on an infrastructure and the efficiency of that overall data center is improved by 10%.\\n\\nThe numbers are huge. And when we do these large language models and recommender systems, the processing is done across the entire data center. And so, we distribute the workload across multiple GPUs, multiple nodes and it runs for a very long time. And so, the importance of the network can be overemphasized.\\n\\nAnd so, the difference of 10% in overall improvement in efficiency, which is very to achieve. The difference between NVIDIA's InfiniBand, the entire software stack with what we call Magnum IO, which allows us to do computing in the network itself. A lot of software is running in the network itself, not just moving data around. We call it in-network computing because a ton of software is done at the edge at the -- within the network itself.\\n\\nWe achieved significant differences in overall efficiency. And so, if you're spending billions of dollars on the infrastructure, or even hundreds of millions of dollars of interest on the infrastructure. The difference is really quite profound.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nYour next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Your line is now open.\\n\\nAmbrish Srivastava -- BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst\\n\\nHi. Thank you very much. I actually had a couple of clarifications. Colette, in the data center side, is it a fair assumption that compute was down Q-over-Q in the reported quarter because the quarter before, Mellanox or the networking business was up as it was called out.\\n\\nAnd again, you said it grew quarter over quarter. So is that a fair assumption? And then, I had a clarification on the USG band. Initially, it was supposed to be a $400 million, really going to what the government was trying to firewall. Is the A800 -- I'm just trying to make sure I understand it.\\n\\nIsn't that against the spirit of what the government is trying to do, i.e., firewall, high-performance compute? Or is A800 going to a different set of customers?\\n\\nColette Kress -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nThank you for the question. So looking at our compute for the quarter is about flattish. Yes, we're seeing also growth growth in terms of our networking, but you should look at our Q3 compute is about flatters with last quarter.\\n\\nJen-Hsun Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nAmbrish, A800 hardware, the hardware of ensures that it always meets U.S. government's clear test for export control. And it cannot be customer reprogrammed or application reprogrammed to exceed it. It is hardware limited.\\n\\nIt is in the hardware that determines 800s capabilities. And so, it meets the clear test in letter and in spirit. We raised the concern about the $400 million of A100s because we were uncertain about whether we could execute. The introduction of A800 to our customers and through our supply chain in time.\\n\\nThe company did remarkable feeds to swarm this situation and make sure that our business was not affected and our customers were not affected. But A800 hardware surely ensures that it always meets U.S. government's clear tests for export control.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nYour next question comes from the line of William Stein with Truist Securities. Your line is now open.\\n\\nWilliam Stein -- Truist Securities -- Analyst\\n\\nThank you. I'm hoping you can discuss the pace of 100 growth as we progress over the next year. We've gotten a lot of questions as to whether the ramp in this product should look like a sort of traditional product cycle where there's quite a bit of pent-up demand for this significant improved performance product and that there's supply available as well. So does this rollout sort of look relatively typical from that perspective? Or should we expect a more perhaps delayed start of the growth trajectory where we see maybe substantially more growth in, let's say, second half of '23.\\n\\nJen-Hsun Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nH-100 ramp is different than the A100 ramp in several ways. The first is that the TCO, the cost benefits, the operational cost benefits because of the energy savings because every data center is now Power Limited. And because of this incredible transformer engine that's designed for the latest AI models. The performance over Ampere is so significant that I -- and because of the pent-up demand for hopper because of these new models that are that I spoke about earlier, deep recommender systems and large language models and generative AI models.\\n\\nCustomers are clamoring to ramp hopper as quickly as possible, and we are trying to do the same. We are all hands on deck to help the cloud service providers stand up the supercomputers. Remember, I is the only company in the world that produces and ships semi-custom supercomputers in high volume. It's a miracle to ship one supercomputer every three years.\\n\\nit's unheard of to ship supercomputers to every cloud service provider in a quarter. And so, we're working hand with every one of them, and every one of them are racing to stand up hoppers. We expect them to have hopper cloud services stood up in Q1. And so, we are expecting to ship some volume, we're expecting to ship production in Q4, and then we're expecting to ship large volumes in Q1.\\n\\nThat's a faster transition than MPIR. And so, it's because of the dynamics that I described.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nYour next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Your line is now open.\\n\\nMatt Ramsay -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\\n\\nYeah. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. I guess, Colette, I heard in your script that you had talked about maybe a new way of commenting on or reporting hyperscaler revenue in your data center business.\\n\\nAnd I wonder if you could maybe give us a little bit more detail about what you're thinking there and what sort of drove the decision? And I guess the derivative of that, Jen-Hsun, how -- that decision to talk about the data center business to hyperscalers differently. I mean, what does that mean for the business that is just a reflection of where demand is and you're going to break things out differently? Or is something changing about the mix of I guess, internal properties versus vertical industry demand within the hyperscale customer base.\\n\\nColette Kress -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nYes, Matt, thanks for the question. Let me clarify a little bit in terms of what we believe we should be looking at when we go forward and discussing our data center business. Our data center business is becoming larger and larger and our customers are complex. And when we talk about hyperscale, we tend to talk about seven, eight different companies.\\n\\nBut the reality is there's a lot of very large companies that we could add to that discussion based on what they're purchasing. Additionally, looking at the cloud, looking at our cloud purchases and what our customers are building for the cloud is an important area to focus on because this is really where our enterprise is where our researchers, where our higher education is also purchasing. So we're trying to look for a better way to describe the color of what we're seeing in the cloud and also give you a better understanding of some of these large installments that we're seeing in the hyperscales.\\n\\nJen-Hsun Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nYes. Let me double click on what Colette just said, which is absolutely right. There are two major dynamics that's happening. First, the adoption of NVIDIA in Internet service companies around the world, the number and the scale by which they're doing it has grown a lot.\\n\\nInternet service companies. And these are Internet service companies that offer services, but they're not public cloud computing companies. The second factor has to do with cloud computing. We are now at the tipping point of cloud computing.\\n\\nAlmost every enterprise in the world has both a cloud-first and a multi-cloud strategy. It is exactly the reason why all of the announcements that we made this year -- this quarter, this last quarter since GTC about all the new platforms that are now available in the cloud. a CSP, a hyperscaler is both -- are two things to us, therefore, a hyperscaler can be a sell to customer. They are also a cell with partner on the public cloud side of their business.\\n\\nBecause of the richness of NVIDIA's ecosystem because we have so many Internet service customers and enterprise customers using NVIDIA's full stack. The public cloud side of their business really enjoys and values the partnership with us and the cell with relationship they have with us. And it's pretty clear now that for all of the hyperscalers, the public cloud side of their business will likely would very likely be the vast majority of their overall consumption. And so, because the world CSPs, the world's public clouds is only at the early innings of their enterprise to lifting enterprise to the cloud world it's very, very clear that the public cloud side of the business is going to be very large.\\n\\nAnd so, increasingly, our relationship with CSPs, our relationship with hyperscalers will -- will include, of course, continuing to sell to them for internal consumption but very importantly, sell with for the public cloud side.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nYour next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\\n\\nJoseph Moore -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk to looking backward at the crypto impact. Obviously, that's gone from your numbers now, but do you see any potential for liquidation of GPUs that are in the mining network, any impact going forward? And do you foresee blockchain being an important part of your business at some point down the road?\\n\\nJen-Hsun Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nWe don't expect to see blockchain being an important part of our business down the road. There is always a resell market. If you look at any of the major resell sites, eBay, for example, there are secondhand graphics cards for sale all the time. And the reason for that is because a 3090 that somebody bought today, is upgraded to a 4090 or 3090 by a couple of years ago, it was up are until 4090 today.\\n\\nThat 3090 could be sold to somebody and enjoyed it sold at the right price. And so, the volume of -- the availability of secondhand and used graphics cards has always been there. And the inventory is never zero. and when the inventory is larger than usual, like all supply demand, it would likely drift lower price and affect the lower ends of our market.\\n\\nBut my sense is that where we're going right now with ADA is targeting very clearly in the upper range, the top half of our market. And and early signs are, and I'm sure you're also seeing that the ADA launch was a home run. That we shipped a large volume of 4090s because as you know, we were prepared for it. And yet within minutes, they were sold out around the world.\\n\\nAnd so, the reception of 4090 and the reception of 4080 today has been off the charts. And that says something about the strength and the health and the vibrancy of the gaming market. So we're super enthusiastic about the ADA launch. We have many more ad products to come.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nYour last question today comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\\n\\nToshiya Hari -- Goldman Sachs -- Analyst\\n\\nGreat. Thank you so much for squeezing me in. I had two quick ones for Colette. On supply, I think there was some mixed messaging in your remarks.\\n\\nI think you talked about supply being a headwind at one point. And then, when you were speaking to the networking business, I think you talked about supply easing. So I was hoping you can kind of speak to supply if you're caught up to demand at this point. And then, secondly, just on stock-based compensation, pretty mundane topic I realize, but it is -- I think in the quarter, it was about $700 million.\\n\\nIt's becoming a bigger piece of your opex. So curious how we should be modeling that going forward.\\n\\nColette Kress -- Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\\n\\nSure. When we look at our supply constraints that we have had in the past, each and every quarter, this is getting better Networking was one of our issues probably a year ago, and it has taken us probably to this quarter. and next quarter to really see our supply improved so that we can support the pipeline that we have for our customers that are -- now that's our supply. We've also made a discussion regarding our customers, supply constraints, issues when setting up a data center, even getting data center capacity has been very difficult.\\n\\nAnd therefore, that challenges them in their purchasing decisions as they're still looking for certain parts of that supply chain to come through. So that hopefully clarifies what we were talking about regarding two areas of supply. In our stock-based compensation, what we'll see, it's very difficult to predict what our stock-based compensation would be when it arrives. We have provided to our incoming employees but also once a year to our employees, and it's a single date in terms of when that is priced.\\n\\nSo it's difficult to determine, but stock-based compensation is an important part of our employees' compensation and will continue to be. So we look at it from an overall compensation perspective. So up until now and when we do the focal, we'll see about the same size with a few additions for the reduced level of employee hiring that we have right now.\\n\\nOperator\\n\\nThank you. I will now turn the call back over to Jen-Hsun Huang for closing remarks.\\n\\nJen-Hsun Huang -- President and Chief Executive Officer\\n\\nThanks, everyone. We are quickly adapting to the macro environment. Correcting inventory levels, offering alternative products to data center customers in China and keeping our opex flat for the next few quarters. Our new platforms are off to a great start and formed the foundation for our resumed growth.\\n\\nMRTX is reinventing 3D graphics with ray tracing and AI. The launch of [Inaudible] is phenomenal. Gamers waited in long lines around the world, 4090 stocks sold out quickly. Hopper, with its revolutionary transformer engine is just in time to meet the surging demand for recommender systems, large language models and generative AI.\\n\\nNVIDIA networking is synonymous with the highest data center throughput and enjoying record results. Oren is the world's first computing platform designed for AI-powered autonomous vehicles and robotics and putting automotive on the road to be our next multibillion-dollar platform. These computing platforms run NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse, software libraries and engines that help the companies build and deploy AI to products and services. we this pioneering work and accelerated computing is more vital than ever.\\n\\nLimited by business, general purpose commuting has slowed to a crawl just as AI demands more computing. Scaling through general purchase computing alone is no longer viable, both from a cost or power standpoint. Accelerated computing is the path forward. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.\\n\\ntl;dr:\""
